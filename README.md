# Community ecology code
Data manipulation in community ecology using different datasets (TRY, sPlot, BIEN) and community ecology index

As part of our scientific methodology, we proceeded to manipulate the data in order to create two distinct databases: one dedicated to the traits of woody species in the Mediterranean region, and the other to the communities of these same species. To do this, we integrated the community data from the _sPlot_ database with the trait data available in the _BIEN_ database. In order to enrich our collection of trait data, for which some information was missing, we also called on the _TRY_ database, an approach which enabled us to efficiently complete our dataset. Before integrating the data into our methodology, it is important to note that the information within the databases has been standardized beforehand. This crucial step ensures data consistency and quality, facilitating comparative analysis and integration.

## How sPlot Works
### Data Integration
sPlot amalgamates vegetation-plot data, including species composition, geographical locations, and environmental conditions from different regions or countries, into a single, accessible framework.
### Standardization
To ensure comparability across datasets, sPlot standardizes data formats, species nomenclature, and environmental variables. This process involves harmonizing scientific names and ensuring consistent measurement units for environmental variables.
### Accessibility
Researchers can access the database for specific projects, adhering to ethical guidelines and data-sharing policies that govern the use of sPlot data.
### Collaboration and Growth
sPlot is designed to be collaborative, allowing contributors to add new datasets continuously. This feature ensures that the database remains up-to-date and reflective of current vegetation patterns and biodiversity.
### Information Contained in sPlot
sPlot hosts a wealth of information crucial for a wide range of ecological inquiries:
- Species Composition: Lists species present in each plot, including vascular plants and sometimes bryophytes and lichens.
- Abundance and Cover: Provides data on the abundance or cover of species, facilitating analyses of community structure.
- Plot Metadata: Includes plot size, sampling date, and methodology.
- Geographical Location: Enables spatial analyses of vegetation patterns across different environmental gradients.
- Environmental Conditions: Offers data on soil, climate, and other conditions for exploring vegetation-environment relationships.
- Temporal Data: Supports studies of vegetation changes over time through repeated plot surveys.
### Applications
The sPlot Database is instrumental in addressing questions related to:
- Global patterns of plant trait diversity
- Effects of climate change on vegetation
- Conservation status of different vegetation types
- Distribution and impact of invasive species
