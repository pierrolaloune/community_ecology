# Community ecology code
Data manipulation in community ecology using different datasets (TRY, sPlot, BIEN) and community ecology index

As part of our scientific methodology, we proceeded to manipulate the data in order to create two distinct databases: one dedicated to the traits of woody species in the Mediterranean region, and the other to the communities of these same species. To do this, we integrated the community data from the _sPlot_ database with the trait data available in the _BIEN_ database. In order to enrich our collection of trait data, for which some information was missing, we also called on the _TRY_ database, an approach which enabled us to efficiently complete our dataset. Before integrating the data into our methodology, it is important to note that the information within the databases has been standardized beforehand. This crucial step ensures data consistency and quality, facilitating comparative analysis and integration.

## How sPlot Works
### Data Integration
sPlot amalgamates vegetation-plot data, including species composition, geographical locations, and environmental conditions from different regions or countries, into a single, accessible framework.
### Standardization
To ensure comparability across datasets, sPlot standardizes data formats, species nomenclature, and environmental variables. This process involves harmonizing scientific names and ensuring consistent measurement units for environmental variables.
### Accessibility
Researchers can access the database for specific projects, adhering to ethical guidelines and data-sharing policies that govern the use of sPlot data.
### Collaboration and Growth
sPlot is designed to be collaborative, allowing contributors to add new datasets continuously. This feature ensures that the database remains up-to-date and reflective of current vegetation patterns and biodiversity.
### Information Contained in sPlot
sPlot hosts a wealth of information crucial for a wide range of ecological inquiries:
- Species Composition: Lists species present in each plot, including vascular plants and sometimes bryophytes and lichens.
- Abundance and Cover: Provides data on the abundance or cover of species, facilitating analyses of community structure.
- Plot Metadata: Includes plot size, sampling date, and methodology.
- Geographical Location: Enables spatial analyses of vegetation patterns across different environmental gradients.
- Environmental Conditions: Offers data on soil, climate, and other conditions for exploring vegetation-environment relationships.
- Temporal Data: Supports studies of vegetation changes over time through repeated plot surveys.
### Applications
The sPlot Database is instrumental in addressing questions related to:
- Global patterns of plant trait diversity
- Effects of climate change on vegetation
- Conservation status of different vegetation types
- Distribution and impact of invasive species

## BIEN and TRY Databases Overview
### BIEN Database
#### Introduction to BIEN
The Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN) is a comprehensive platform that aggregates and standardizes global botanical data. Its primary aim is to support large-scale analyses of plant biodiversity, biogeography, and trait distributions. By integrating botanical observations, specimen records, and trait data from various sources, BIEN facilitates research on plant diversity patterns and responses to environmental changes.
#### How BIEN Works
- Data Aggregation: BIEN compiles botanical data from herbarium records, plot inventories, and observational datasets, offering a unified resource for exploring global plant diversity.
- Standardization and Quality Control: The database employs rigorous data cleaning and standardization protocols to ensure data accuracy and comparability. This includes verifying species nomenclature and harmonizing trait measurements.
- Accessibility and Tools: BIEN provides user-friendly tools for data exploration, species distribution modeling, and trait analysis. Researchers can access spatially explicit data on species occurrences and traits to conduct biodiversity assessments.
#### Information in BIEN
- Species Occurrence Records: Geographic locations and environmental settings where plant species have been observed or collected.
- Plant Traits: Standardized measurements of plant functional traits, such as leaf size, wood density, and seed mass, which are critical for understanding ecological strategies.
- Taxonomic Information: Detailed taxonomic hierarchies and synonymy, facilitating research on biodiversity patterns across taxonomic groups.
- Phylogenetic Trees: Phylogenetic relationships among plant species, supporting studies on evolutionary patterns and trait evolution.
### TRY Database
#### Introduction to TRY
The TRY Plant Trait Database is a global repository that collates plant trait data with the objective of improving our understanding of plant functional diversity. Managed by a consortium of international researchers, TRY focuses on making trait data accessible to the scientific community to foster research on climate change impacts, ecosystem services, and biodiversity conservation.
#### How TRY Works
- Collaborative Data Collection: TRY compiles plant trait data from published studies, databases, and direct contributions from researchers worldwide.
- Trait Harmonization: The database standardizes trait definitions and units, offering a consistent framework for trait data. This includes a comprehensive trait ontology covering various plant functional traits.
- Data Availability: Researchers can request access to TRY data for specific projects, subject to data use agreements that respect data contributors' conditions.
#### Information in TRY
- Plant Functional Traits: An extensive collection of quantitative traits, including physiological, morphological, and phenological traits, for thousands of plant species.
- Metadata: Contextual information accompanying trait measurements, such as experimental conditions, growth forms, and geographic locations.
- Data Sources: References and origins of the trait data, ensuring transparency and traceability.
